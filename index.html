			<h1 style="font-size: 24px; color: white; padding-right: 15%; padding-left: 15%;">Hello! I am a Digital Media Art Major attending San Jose State University. I never thought i was going to be an art major growing up, so I am rather new at being an artist. I started my art craft while I was at San Joaquin Delta College and have particularly fell in love with editing videos and adding cool effects to my works. As of now, I just enjoy trying to make art that looks cool and follows a certain mood or feeling, but I am slowly learning how to add intention behind the artistic choices I make. With that being said, I really enjoy creating works and manipulating works that look visually appealing to the eye. My artistic craft has been expanding more and more; however, with myself becoming more interested in drawing, storytelling, and animation. I hope to one day use these skills all together to create works that tell a story with meaning important to me behind it with amazing art to go along with it. </h1>
